# Contributing to Froglet

Thank you for taking the time to read this document. If you have it means you
want to help! Which is very much appreciated! :+1: 

This repo uses Lerna to manage each "package" separately. At this time it's not
fully configured, so just keep in mind as you proceed tackling issues.

## Roadmap

See the full [Roadmap](https://github.com/frogletjs/froglet/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) for all 
functional plans for Froglet. 

As an addendum to this in terms of Contrbuting, this project will eventually
add its own ESLINT and Prettier configuration to manage contributing specifics.
