# Froglet Prettier Config

Configuration for sharing 
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html#sharing-configurations)
across projects. 

## Usage

Simply install this as a scoped project:

```
npm install @froglet/prettier-config --save-dev
```

Update your `package.json` file to reference new config:

```
{
"prettier": "@froglet/prettier-config"
}
```

That's it! You're off to the races on our custom rules.
